# Dot Files
This is a collection of dotfiles that I use across all of the computers I work on.

# Emacs
Inside the emacs folder you will find init.el and the elisp folder, both of these need to be symlinked into the `$HOME/.emacs.d` folder

## Elisp Folder
This folder has all custom emacs scripts, the init.el should have a line that adds this to the load path
